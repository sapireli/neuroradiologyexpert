In legal cases involving the brain, spine, or the CNS (Central Nervous System), the facts aren’t always visible to the naked eye. For example, a person sues someone for damages after a car accident, claiming that the victim has suffered a traumatic brain injury. The defense says the scans are normal, and the plaintiff’s symptoms are exaggerated. Both sides have medical records, but the jury has no idea what they are looking at, and neither do the attorneys. Who steps in there to make sense of it all? That’s where a [neuroscience expert witness can step in](/blog/winning-personal-injury-cases-with-neuroradiology-expertise/) with their impartial opinion. So, when exactly does a lawyer decide to bring a seasoned neuroradiologist witness into the picture? Let’s break it down!

## #1 Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Cases

This is one of the most common situations where a [neuroradiology expert witness](/our-services/forensic-neuroradiology/) is incredibly essential. When someone claims they have suffered a TBI after an accident, whether it’s a car crash, a fall, or a sports injury, the neuroradiologist can examine the brain scans and determine if there’s evidence to support the claim. As professionals, they identify signs of injury that may not be obvious, like micro-hemorrhages or diffuse axonal injury, and explain their findings in a way the jury can understand.

## #2 Medical Malpractice Lawsuits

Is your client suffering due to medical malpractice, as a brain tumor was missed on a previous scan? Did a radiologist overlook a sign of a stroke? In malpractice cases, a neuroradiologist expert witness can help review imaging and assess whether the standard of care was followed. Their insights can help attorneys prove whether a medical error caused avoidable harm or defend the defendant against such crimes.

## #3 Criminal Trials

In criminal cases, especially those involving physical abuse or trauma to the head, neuroradiologists can analyze imaging to determine the nature, timing, and possible cause of brain injuries. For example, in suspected shaken baby syndrome, a neuroradiologist’s opinion might be key in establishing whether the injuries are consistent with abuse or accidental injury.

## #4 Disability and Insurance Claims

When a person applies for long-term disability due to neurological impairment, insurers can demand clear medical evidence. A neuroradiologist can review existing imaging or order new scans to provide an expert opinion on the severity and implications of a condition.

## #5 Toxic Exposure or Environmental Lawsuits

In rare but complex cases involving exposure to harmful substances, such as lead, industrial chemicals, or environmental toxins, a neuroradiologist can evaluate whether any neurological damage can be detected through imaging, which can help link health outcomes to environmental causes.

## Final Thoughts

In short, attorneys can turn to neuroradiology expert witnesses when the truth is buried in medical imaging, and the truth needs to be made crystal clear in the courtroom. Whether it’s a subtle brain injury or a missed diagnosis, their unbiased ability to interpret and explain those findings can be a major turning point in the case.
