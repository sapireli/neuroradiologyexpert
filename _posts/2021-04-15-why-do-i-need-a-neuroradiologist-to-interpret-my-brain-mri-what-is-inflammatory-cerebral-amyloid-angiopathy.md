This is one of our published cases that illustrates the necessity of a neuroradiology expert when dealing with neuroimaging and neurological symptoms. This patient was thought to have a stroke after image interpretation by a non-neuroradiologist and the plan was to do an extensive and invasive stroke work-up including trans-esophageal echocardiography. Comparison to prior studies and knowledge of a relatively uncommon entity led the neurology team to the correct diagnosis. Click on the image to see the case.
