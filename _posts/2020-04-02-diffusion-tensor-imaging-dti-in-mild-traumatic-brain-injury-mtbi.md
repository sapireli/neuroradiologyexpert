## What is Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)?
An MRI sequence or image that allows evaluation of the anatomy and integrity of white matter tracts.

## Why is Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) important?
Conventional CT and MRI often miss subtle diffuse axonal injuries, raising the specter of false negative findings.

There is a need for more accurate and reliable recognition of mild TBI.

Can not rely on subjective symptom reporting, in the context of secondary monetary gain .

** Note: “Normal” brain MRI does not exclude possibility of mild TBI.**
