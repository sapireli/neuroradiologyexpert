This is one of our published cases that illustrates the necessity of a neuroradiology expert when dealing with neuroimaging and neurological symptoms. This patient was going for a lumbar spine surgery based on minor abnormalities on her lumbar spine MRI and right sided radiculopathy in S1 nerve distribution. A sacral plexus MRI was then obtained witch showed the cause of her symptoms.
