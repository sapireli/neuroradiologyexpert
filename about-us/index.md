## Medical-legal imaging guidance

<div class="split-block">
  <div>
    <p>Imaging is an essential component of a comprehensive approach to neurological disease diagnosis, especially in setting of trauma. In many cases, imaging is the sole objective evidence that supports the true diagnosis and extent of disease. Validity of neuro-imaging and its contribution to the outcome of a litigation depends on type and quality of images and accuracy of interpretation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="split-media">
    <ul class="list-check">
      <li>Complimentary initial consultation. Call or email us for a second opinion if your neuroimaging was not interpreted by a board and CAQ certified neuroradiologist.</li>
      <li>Comprehensive neuroradiology medical-legal evaluation for attorneys.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

<ul class="list-check">
  <li>Call or email us if you believe your client's imaging was misinterpreted. Misinterpretation of imaging findings can mislead and erroneously change the course of a litigation. For example, common findings of traumatic brain injury (TBI) such as subtle "subarachnoid hemorrhage", "brain contusion", and "volume loss and gliosis", are regularly missed or misinterpreted by non-expert neuroradiologists.</li>
  <li>Advanced MR imaging sequences such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) provide insight on location, extent, and severity of TBI. These sequences are frequently interpreted inaccurately by non-expert radiologists. Clinical and research expertise in DTI imaging allows our TBI imaging expert witnesses' accurate interpretation of advanced modalities.</li>
  <li>Contact us with questions about DTI.</li>
</ul>
