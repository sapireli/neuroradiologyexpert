<div class="faq-accordion">
  <details>
    <summary>What is Forensic Neuropsychology?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Forensic neuropsychology is a subspecialty that applies brain-behavior principles to legal decision-making. It involves evaluating cognitive and psychological impairments in relation to legal issues, such as the competency to stand trial or compensation claims.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What are the preconditions for a forensic neuropsychological evaluation?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>The evaluation requires a referral (usually from an attorney, doctor, or insurance provider), as well as a review of relevant records.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Who are the experts involved?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Forensic neuropsychologists are trained clinical neuropsychologists with specialized expertise in legal matters.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What are the legal provisions for forensic neuropsychology?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Forensic neuropsychology is grounded in established brain-behavior science and operates within the broader legal standards governing expert testimony. In the United States, the Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (1993) ruling set key criteria for the admissibility of expert testimony, requiring that such testimony be based on reliable methods, peer-reviewed science, known error rates, and general acceptance within the scientific community.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What types of cases require forensic neuropsychology?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Please <a href="/contact-us/">get in touch with us</a> to discuss your specific situations.</p>
      <p>Forensic neuropsychology is relevant in any legal matter where cognitive, emotional, or behavioral functioning is in question.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personal Injury Claims</strong> - evaluation of cognitive, emotional, or behavioral effects following head injury, concussion, or trauma.</li>
        <li><strong>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) Litigation</strong> - determining the presence, severity, and impact of brain injury.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Malpractice</strong> - assessing whether neurological or cognitive deficits resulted from medical error or negligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Workers' Compensation</strong> - evaluating cognitive or psychological impairment related to workplace injuries or exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Disability Determination</strong> - establishing cognitive or psychological limitations relevant to Social Security or private disability claims.</li>
        <li><strong>Criminal Proceedings</strong> - assessing competency to stand trial, criminal responsibility, or mitigation related to neurological or psychiatric impairment.</li>
        <li><strong>Capacity and Guardianship Evaluations</strong> - determining decision-making capacity in civil, medical, or financial matters.</li>
        <li><strong>Neurodegenerative and Psychiatric Conditions</strong> - evaluating cognitive decline or dysfunction affecting functioning or legal competence.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness-for-Duty / Return-to-Work Assessments</strong> - determining whether cognitive or emotional limitations interfere with occupational performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Toxic Exposure / Environmental Claims</strong> - assessing neurocognitive consequences of exposure to substances such as lead, carbon monoxide, or solvents.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Who can schedule a forensic evaluation?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>While anyone seeking an objective assessment may request a forensic evaluation, these evaluations are most often arranged by attorneys, insurance representatives, human resources professionals, or other parties involved in legal, occupational, or administrative proceedings.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>What does a forensic neuropsychological evaluation involve?</summary>

        <li>Review of relevant records</li>
        <li>Interviews and consultation</li>
        <li>Administration of psychological, validity, and neurocognitive measures</li>
        <li>Comprehensive neuropsychological report and possible court testimony/deposition</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can I bill my insurance for a forensic evaluation?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>No, insurance cannot be billed for these assessments as they are not considered medically necessary.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How long does it take to receive my report?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Reports are typically available within 2 weeks after the evaluation, depending on urgency.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Do I need to prepare before my appointment?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Just bring any required assistive devices (glasses, hearing aids), take your regular medications, and get a good night's sleep. Completing any pre-appointment forms will help speed up the process.</p>
