## DTI Neuroimaging

<p>One of the advanced services we offer is <em>Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI)</em> interpretation, a state-of-the-art MRI technique that determines the integrity of the white matter tracts of the brain by measuring water diffusion within these tracts. The utility of DTI neuroimaging includes:</p>

    <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/000001.png" alt="White matter imaging">
    <h3>White Matter Imaging</h3>
    <p>With DTI imaging, neuroradiologists can get insights into white matter integrity and anatomy, which is essential for evaluation of conditions like traumatic brain injury and brain tumors.</p>

    <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Microhemorrhages-Minor-TBI-edit.jpg" alt="Detection of traumatic axonal injury">
    <h3>Detection of Traumatic Axonal Injury</h3>
    <p>Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) can be effective in identifying traumatic axonal injuries, which occur when the brain's connectivity is damaged.</p>

    <h3>Comprehensive Mapping of Fiber Tracts</h3>
    <p>Diffusion tensor imaging in tumor imaging and traumatic brain injury is also used to create detailed maps of fiber tracts in the human brain.</p>

## Perfusion Imaging

<div class="split-block">
  <div>
    <p>Perfusion images help assess blood flow to different regions of the brain and are especially useful in diagnosing conditions such as stroke, brain tumors, and certain types of dementia.</p>

## Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS)

<p>With MRS, we measure the levels of specific chemicals in the brain tissue to diagnose and monitor conditions like brain tumors and metabolic disorders.</p>

## Why Neuroradiology?

<div class="split-block">
  <div>
    <p>Neuroradiology is a specialized branch of radiology focused on the imaging and diagnosis of diseases related to the central nervous system (CNS), brain, head, neck, and spine. Our expert neuroradiologists use magnetic fields, X-rays, and advanced imaging technologies to get highly detailed images of the human brain and spinal cord.</p>
