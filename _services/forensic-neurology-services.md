## When to Engage a Forensic Neurology Expert

<p>You need forensic neurological services when a case requires objective, medically grounded answers about injury, causation, or functional impact. Without expert interpretation, neurologic findings can be misread or undervalued, weakening the clarity and strength of your legal position. We help attorneys and courts understand complex clinical findings and connect them directly to the legal issues that matter.</p>

<div class="callout">
  <h3>Did You Know?</h3>

## FAQ

<div class="faq-accordion">
  <details>
    <summary>What does a forensic neurology evaluation involve?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Our evaluations go far beyond a standard clinical visit. We conduct a comprehensive investigation to establish facts. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comprehensive History and Record Review:</strong> We gather detailed history and analyze medical records, police reports, employment files, military records, and witness statements.</li>
        <li><strong>Neurological Examination:</strong> We perform focused physical and cognitive assessments to evaluate neurological function.</li>
        <li><strong>Collateral Interviews:</strong> We speak with family members or witnesses to confirm behavioral patterns and event timelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Additional Testing When Needed:</strong> We recommend further studies such as MRI, CT, EEG, psychiatric evaluations, or neuropsychological testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Intent and Behavior Analysis:</strong> We determine whether neurological factors may have influenced actions or decision-making.</li>
        <li><strong>Medico-Legal Interpretation:</strong> We provide clear, defensible opinions that directly address the legal questions in the case.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How do you determine the link between a diagnosis and legal liability?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>We utilize a rigorous three-step reasoning process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Diagnostic:</strong> Confirming the presence or absence of a neurologic diagnosis (e.g., TBI, epilepsy, dementia).</li>
        <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> Analyzing how that specific diagnosis affected the individual's behavior, cognition, and mental capacity.</li>
        <li><strong>Forensic:</strong> Determining if these impairments meet the specific legal criteria for the case (e.g., insanity, incompetence, or damages).</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>How does your role as a forensic expert differ from that of a treating physician?</summary>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>While a treating physician focuses on patient welfare, our primary duty in a forensic context is to the truth. We provide objective, educational opinions to the judge and jury. We report findings based on evidence, regardless of whether the outcome favors the evaluee, ensuring the highest level of ethical integrity and credibility in court.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Can your neurologists testify effectively during trial proceedings?</summary>

  </details>
  <details>
    <summary>Who can schedule a forensic evaluation?</summary>
